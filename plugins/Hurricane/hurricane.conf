# "Fixes" Bedrock players running into lagback issues on certain blocks by removing any collision detection from the given block.
# Caveats: a custom client - Java or Bedrock - could take advantage of no collision and walk right through.
#  Additionally, placement of these blocks on both platforms may be buggier than usual.
